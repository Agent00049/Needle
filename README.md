Needle is the only chrome extension you may need to have one click access to your bug submissions across various platforms.
No need to create any bookmark, type on the url bar and have fuss with autocomplete problems.

Right now the list included is-
1. Hackerone
2. Bugcrowd
3. Intigriti 
4. Yes we hack

and added support as-
1. H1 Publicly disclosed reports. (from h1.nobbd.de)
2. Link to #bugbountytips (via @TheBugBot)
